udd (Donald) is most well-known for his interesting use of color and rectangular forms. These elements are the basis of my experiments with the letter J, but thereâ€™s a whole other angle of light and shadows and dimensionality in space that I would love to play with as well. In his work, Judd sought autonomy and clarity for the constructed object and the space created by it, ultimately achieving a rigorously democratic presentation without compositional hierarchy.
